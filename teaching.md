# Teaching Activities

## Cyber Security and Networking Modules

I have been actively involved in the teaching and development of various undergraduate and 
postgraduate modules focusing on **cyber security** and **computer networking**. 
These modules are designed to provide students with both theoretical knowledge 
and practical skills. 

My teaching includes:

- Network security fundamentals.  
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing.  
- Secure programming.  
- Protocol analysis and secure communications.  
- Cyber security law, policy, and regulations.
- Network design and architecture

## Project Supervision

My student supervision is closely aligned with my research interests, 
particularly in **cyber security**, **network resilience**, 
and **intelligent threat detection**. 
I have supervised a wide range of projects that not only contribute to student learning 
but also to the research outputs of our department.

### Notable Supervised Work

- **Development of Attack simulation plugin for in OMNeT++/Veins/sumo**: 
	A project currently being developed on GitHub that models different types 
	of Network attacks within OMNeT++.
- **AI-based intrusion detection system**: 
	UG and PG projects that explored anomalies the use of ML/DL in the context of 
	anomaly detection.
- **Cybersecurity Awareness Games for Schools**: 
	Student-developed serious games that are now used in community outreach 
	and public engagement activities.
- **Blockchain Solutions for Healthcare Applications**: 
	This project investigates the use of private blockchain technologies to assess 
	their feasibility for healthcare applications.

	
Many of these projects contribute directly to my ongoing research and in some cases, 
have evolved into co-authored publications or software tools.

- OMNET++ plugin for the the simulation of Ad-hoc network attacks.**Github Repo coming soon**
- OMNET++ plugin for the the simulation of Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET)attacks.**Github Repo coming soon**

Stay tuned — more code and research outputs will be made available on my 
[GitHub](https://github.com/asmaadnane) repository soon, 
particularly focusing on **OMNeT++ cyber attack simulations** a
nd **data-driven security analytics**.
