## Background

I'm currently a Senior Lecturer in the Computer Science department of Loughborough University.

After getting My PhD in 2008 at the university of Rennes in France, I hold a postdoc at polytechNantes, 
and was working as a research assistant for different universities in France 
(polytech Nantes, university of Rennes, ENSI Bourges and ESAIP-Angers).

Before joining Loughborough, I was a senior lecturer in the University of Derby (2013-2018) 
and a KTP associate at the university of Leicester and Crowdlab â€“ Leicester (2011-2013).

My main research focus is on Networks and Security.
