## Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Worldline LtD

**Funder:** Innovate UK  
**Project Partner:** Worldline Ltd.  
**Start Date:** August 2024  
**Status:** Ongoing

## CyberQuest: Play, Learn, Protect!

**Funder:** Innovate UK - CyberLocal  
**Duration:** January – March 2025  
**Status:** Completed

CyberQuest is a short-term exploratory project aimed at improving 
**cyber security awareness in school** at the community level. 

The purpose of CyberQuest is to increase cyber awareness of children and parents 
through the means of a card game. The game is intended for year 5 and 6 pupils 
(usually ages 9-11) and aims to foster conversations around key cyber quests.

Project highlights include:  
- Engagement with local schools to understand their cyber security issues and challenges.  
- Development of a board game to promote cyber awareness through parent–child 
interaction at home  
- Design of in-class activities and games to reinforce safe online behaviour in a fun and accessible way.  
- Creation of a set of **recommendations for improving cyber security education in the national curriculum**

## University-Funded PhD Scholarship

I have been awarded and supervised three PhD scholarships aligned with my research interests. 
These projects have covered a range of cyber security topics and fostered collaborations across disciplines.

1. **Trust evaluation framework for vehicular networks**
	- **Funder:** University Of Derby
	- **Student:** [Dr. Farhan Ahmad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhan-ahmad-phd-2b4ba330/) - **Status:** Completed 2017
	- **Focus:**  we proposed a novel Trust Evaluation And Management (TEAM) framework,
which serves as a unique paradigm for the design, management and evaluation of trust models in
various contexts and in presence of malicious vehicles.

2. **Optimal Governance of Data in the Ecosystem of
Connected Vehicles With Assistance of Maturity
Model**
	- **Funder:** Loughborough University
	- **Student:** Dr. Ali Karimi - **Status:** Completed 2025
	- **Focus:** This research focuses on developing a comprehensive data governance 
	framework for Connected Vehicles (CVs) to address challenges related to data volume, 
	velocity, heterogeneity, security, and regulatory compliance. 
	The research employed a qualitative strategy using the Delphi method
	 to conduct expert interviews across multiple sectors, followed by thematic analysis 
	 with NVivo to evaluate and refine the proposed data governance framework for Connected 
	 Vehicles.

3. **Human aspects in cybersecurity in connected and autonomous vehicles** 
	- **Funder:** Loughborough University
	- **Student:** Dua'a Hamdan  - **Status:** Ongoing  
	- **Focus:** Interdisciplinary research between cyber security and design, 
	 exploring how design thinking can enhance digital safety and user engagement
